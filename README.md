A basic prototype that takes the XBRL filing (in the form of a string), parses it and retrieves data embedded in the filing.
Implements appropriate methods to extract the parsed data.

All companies (such as Infosys or Tata Steel) whose stocks are listed on National Stock Exchange (NSE) or Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) are required to report key business information in XBRL format (the so-called ‘Corporate
Filings’). Examples: quarterly financial statements (including revenue, profit, etc.), shareholding pattern, annual
reports, etc.

XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) is the most widely used global framework for reporting &
exchanging business information.

An example filing, from Infosys for quarter ending 30-Jun-2023 is available at
